# NYC-squirrels

This dataset from 2018 contains data about 3000+ squirrel sightings, such as age, fur color, activities, interaction with humans, etc.

We can think of many questions:

- What was the date for the highest number of sightings?
- Who runs more, adults or juveniles?
- Which squirrels are more willing to approach humans, and in which areas?
- Do squirrels who approach humans eat more frequently?
- We can also group squirrels by location, fur color, and age and see if they are connected to squirrels' activities.
